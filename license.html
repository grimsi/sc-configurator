        1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.<br/><br/>
        Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:<br/><br/>
        1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.<br/>
        1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.<br/>
        1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.<br/><br/>
        2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,<br/>
        share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's<br/>
        creator(s) a pint.<br/><br/>
        3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes<br/>
        you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.</p>
